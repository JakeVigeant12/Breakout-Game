### Notes/Assumptions

Assumptions or Simplifications:
I assumed that each component of the game would be constant - i.e. the ball is always a ball and the bricks are always 
rectangles filled with a singular color. The current method of populating the bricks assumes that the level does not begin
with any missing/nonuniformly sized bricks.
